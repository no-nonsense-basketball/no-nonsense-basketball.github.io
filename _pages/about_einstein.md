To request a personalized workout, I require the following information to ensure that this workout will fit your needs. The more detailed information you provide, the better the workout will be for you.

Step 1: Send an email to nononsensebasketball@gmail.com

Step 2: Include your age, height, and position you play on your team.

Step 3: Include your current situation. For instance, practice player for JV, or bench on varsity. 

Step 4: Include your skill level, and weaknesses - things you struggle with and need to improve on the most. Weaknesses you list should be the things that are holding you back from making it to the next level.
