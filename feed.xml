Check out the other posts. Still struggling? Visit the Personalized Workouts tab for help. Step 1: Stretch - This is often the most overlooked part of working out. You can’t be explosive or fast if you aren’t flexible. Find a good stretching/mobility routine.</p> <p>Step 2: Ball Handling - This is a MUST HAVE for every workout. Doesn’t have to be too long, but it is important to ensure that you keep your handles sharp. If you are a beginner, I recommend spending at least 15 minutes on ball handling during each workout.</p> <p>Step 3: Form shots - Don’t start shooting by chucking up threes. Start at the basket and work your way out.</p> <p>Step 4: Identify what your role is on the team you play on, or certain situations that occur repeatedly during games. For instance, if you are normally a shooter on your team, work on pump fakes and driving out of the corner if you are forced off the three point line. If you are a center, work on moves in the specific places on the court where you find yourself catching the ball the most. After determining what you want to work on, stick with that same drill over and over until you feel comfortable. Depending on time, and the amount of moves you want to work on, I would recommend getting at least 10 makes for each drill you do. If you find yourself struggling or uncomfortable with the drill you are doing, keep doing it.</p> <p>Step 5: Shooting - This is for everyone, whether you are a center, or a guard. If you can consistently hit three pointers, you will give the coach a reason to play you. I recommend making AT LEAST 300-500 3s a week. Place a bigger focus on the looks you see in game. If you are seeing certain looks in game, such as catch and shoot wing 3s, focus more on that. Also, if you are a guard, work on the midrange as well. If you can consistently hit midranges on top of threes, you will scary to guard.</p> <p>OPTIONAl: Looking to improve your conditioning? If you want to play in varsity and beyond, you NEED to be conditioned. I personally run a full court suicide right after stretching, another after ball handling, one suicide after each drill, and one suicide every 20 makes in the shooting portion of my workout. Set a goal timing wise, so you can push yourself to become faster. I personally set a goal to do each suicide in under 26 seconds.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Tips"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stop wasting time when you work out.

When I first created my schedule, I was shocked with the amount of free time that I was able to dedicate towards basketball. Many kids make the excuse that they have a ton of homework, but they are wasting their time scrolling, playing video games, etc. If you are serious and really want to improve, you will have to make some sacrifices.</p> <p>Link to Template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nWOPiSzv3hW2wQ-ttRkRfw_be1e18Q-jQgwnff-R1w/edit?tab=t.0</p> <hr/>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Tips"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are serious about taking your game to the next level, you cannot afford to waste any time.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Are VKTRY Insoles worth it?</title><link href="https://no-nonsense-basketball.github.io/2025/01/22/twitter.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are VKTRY Insoles worth it?"/><published>2025-01-22T05:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-22T05:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://no-nonsense-basketball.github.io/2025/01/22/twitter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://no-nonsense-basketball.github.io/2025/01/22/twitter.html"><![CDATA[<p>I personally didn’t spend any money on VKTRY Insoles, as I got them for free from school.

When playing with the insoles, I did feel more explosive when running, but this may be a placebo effect, where I felt a boost in my speed due to the expectation of the soles making a difference. Wearing the insoles also hurt my feet for awhile as it took some time to break in.

It has helped me tremendously, and after consistently doing this exercise, I saw a huge jump in my explosiveness off my first step, as well as my overall speed. If you are a beginner hold this for 30 seconds, and do three sets of these. Do these every other day. If you are advanced/stronger, hold these for 45 seconds each set, and do three sets. Do these EVERY single day, and they are great before starting your basketball workouts. If these are still too easy, I recommend doing these with your heel up as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Banded Knee Drives: This exercise targets your hips, glutes and hamstrings. This waws another exercise that helped me tremendously. I recommend doing three sets of 12 reps. If you are stronger, do these everyday and preferably right before your basketball workouts, just like the bulgarian split squat hold.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jump Rope: Jumping rope may sound simple, but it is great for improving quickness and your vertical. I strongly recommend doing these everyday, especially right before your basketball workouts. It will get you warm and bouncy. Beginners can jump rope for 1-2 mins, while if you are stronger you can even up it to 5 mins. You can also jump rope off of one leg if you are looking to challenge yourself further.</p> </li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Strength/Conditioning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking to become more explosive and jump higher?
