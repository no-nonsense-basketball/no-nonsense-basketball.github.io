1. Continuous Pound Dribbles: Do this drill for 30 seconds with each hand, and repeat three times. This drill will get you accustomed to controlling the ball. If you can, try to do this with your eyes up. Dribble as hard and as fast as possible, and challenge yourself. Don't be afraid to mess up. After you get the hang of doing it stationary, start running up and down the court while dribbling with each hand.
2. One Dribble crossover: Do this drill for 30 seconds, and repeat three times. This will allow you to get accustomed to performing a crossover. After you get the hang of doing it stationary, start doing it while moving up and down the court.
3. One Dribble Between the Legs: Do this drill for 30 seconds, and repeat three times. This will allow you to get accustomed to performing a between the legs dribble. After you get the hang of doing it stationary, start doing it while moving up and down the court.
4. One Dribble Behind the Back: Do this drill for 30 seconds, and repeat three times. This will allow you to get accustomed to performing a behind the back dribble. After you get the hang of doing it stationary, start doing it while moving up and down the court.
