1. Continuous Pound Dribbles: Do this drill for 30 seconds with each hand, and repeat three times. This drill will get you accustomed to controlling the ball. If you can, try to do this with your eyes up. Dribble as hard and as fast as possible, and challenge yourself. Don't be afraid to mess up. After you get the hang of doing it stationary, start running up and down the court while dribbling with each hand.
2. One Dribble cross: Do this drill for 30 seconds, and repeat three times. This will allow you to get accustomed to performing a crossover.
