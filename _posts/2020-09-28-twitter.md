I personally didn't spend any money on VKTRY Insoles, as I got them for free from school. For me personally, they did not improve my vertical jump. I tested my jump without using the insoles and with, and I got the exact same results. When playing with the insoles, I did feel more explosive when running, but this may be a placebo effect, where I felt a boost in my speed due to the expectation of the soles making a difference. Wearing the insoles also hurt my feet for awhile as it took some time to break in. Overall, I would not recommend buying them, and I think they aren't worth the price.
