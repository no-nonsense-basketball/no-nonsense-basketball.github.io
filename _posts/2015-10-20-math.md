You don't absolutely need these items to get better, but I strongly recommend getting them if possible.

1. Massage Gun: These can help improve your circulation, relieve pain from sore muscles, reduce muscle tension, and increase your range of motion. I personally used this before my workouts/games, as well as before I went to sleep.

2. Resistance Bands: These will greatly increase your mobility, explosiveness, and vertical leap. I recommend performing resistance band related exercises before your workouts/games, as they will help your body perform at its maximum explosiveness.

3. Balance Pad: This is great for working on your balance, as well as performing certain stretches, such as the couch stretch or bulgarian split squat hold.

4. Foam Roller: This is great for helping relieve soreness and improving blood flow and mobility.
