Step 1: Start with Priorities - Since academics are FIRST, while you are creating your schedule ensure that you are accounting for the time spent getting ready for school, in school, and doing homework. I personally allotted 2-3 hours a day for my homework/studying time - I was able to get straight As in all my classes, and I was taking AP Calculus AB in my sophmore year.

Step 2: Identify available time to workout. 

Step 3: Yes, it's that simple. When I first created my schedule, I was shocked with the amount of free time that I was able to dedicate towards basketball. Many kids make the excuse that they have a ton of homework, but they are wasting their time scrolling, playing video games, etc. If you are serious and really want to improve, you will have to make some sacrifices.
