A quick google/youtube search will show you how to perform these exercises.

1. 90 90s: This stretch targets many of the muscles surrounding the hip capsule, including your glutes, hips, and lower back. This will help increase your hip's internal and external rotation. If your hip mobility is already good, do these 90 90s with your hands in the air and not touching the ground. I recommend doing 10-12 reps.
   
2. Pigeon Stretch: This stretch stretches your hips, glutes, and groin. It will improve your range of motion and relieve tension within these areas and can also strengthen your lower back. Hold it for 45-60 seconds.
   
3. Couch Stretch: This stretch loosens your hip flexors and engages your glutes. Hold it for 30-45 secs.
